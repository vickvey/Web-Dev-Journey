    <h1>Seahorse</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is any of 46 species of
      small marine fish in the genus Hippocampus. "Hippocampus" comes from the
      Ancient Greek hippókampos (ἱππόκαμπος), itself from híppos (ἵππος) meaning
      "horse" and kámpos (κάμπος) meaning "sea monster"[4][5] or "sea
      animal".[6] Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also
      feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile
      tail.[7] Along with the pipefishes and seadragons (Phycodurus and
      Phyllopteryx) they form the family Syngnathidae.

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate salt water
      throughout the world, from about 45°S to 45°N.[8] They live in sheltered
      areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves. Four
      species are found in Pacific waters from North America to South America.
      In the Atlantic, Hippocampus erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay.
      H. zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.
      Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.[9]
      Three species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the
      long-snouted seahorse), H. hippocampus (the short-snouted seahorse), and
      H. fuscus (the sea pony). These species form territories; males stay
      within 1 m2 (10 sq ft) of habitat, while females range over about one
      hundred times that[10].

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Seahorses range in size from 1.5 to 35 cm (0.6 to 13.8 in).[11] They are
      named for their equine appearance, with bent necks and long snouted heads
      and a distinctive trunk and tail. Although they are bony fish, they do not
      have scales, but rather thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates,
      which are arranged in rings throughout their bodies. Each species has a
      distinct number of rings.[12] The armor of bony plates also protects them
      against predators,[13] and because of this outer skeleton, they no longer
      have ribs.[14] Seahorses swim upright, propelling themselves using the
      dorsal fin, another characteristic not shared by their close pipefish
      relatives, which swim horizontally. Razorfish are the only other fish that
      swim vertically. The pectoral fins, located on either side of the head
      behind their eyes, are used for steering. They lack the caudal fin typical
      of fishes. Their prehensile tail is composed of square-like rings that can
      be unlocked only in the most extreme conditions.[15] They are adept at
      camouflage, and can grow and reabsorb spiny appendages depending on their
      habitat.[16] Unusual among fish, a seahorse has a flexible, well-defined
      neck. It also sports a crown-like spine or horn on its head, termed a
      "coronet", which is distinct for each species.[17] Seahorses swim very
      poorly, rapidly fluttering a dorsal fin and using pectoral fins to steer.
      The slowest-moving fish in the world is H. zosterae (the dwarf seahorse),
      with a top speed of about 1.5 m (5 ft) per hour.[18] Since they are poor
      swimmers, they are most likely to be found resting with their prehensile
      tail wound around a stationary object. They have long snouts, which they
      use to suck up food, and their eyes can move independently of each other
      like those of a chameleon.[19]

    <h2>Evolution and fossil record</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Anatomical evidence, supported by molecular, physical, and genetic
      evidence, demonstrates that seahorses are highly modified pipefish. The
      fossil record of seahorses, however, is very sparse. The best known and
      best studied fossils are specimens of Hippocampus guttulatus (though
      literature more commonly refers to them under the synonym of H.
      ramulosus), from the Marecchia River formation of Rimini Province, Italy,
      dating back to the Lower Pliocene, about 3 million years ago. The earliest
      known seahorse fossils are of two pipefish-like species, H. sarmaticus and
      H. slovenicus, from the coprolitic horizon of Tunjice Hills, a middle
      Miocene lagerstätte in Slovenia dating back about 13 million years.[20]
      Molecular dating implies that pipefish and seahorses diverged during the
      Late Oligocene. This has led to speculation that seahorses evolved in
      response to large areas of shallow water, newly created as the result of
      tectonic events. The shallow water would have allowed the expansion of
      seagrass habitats that served as camouflage for the seahorses' upright
      posture.[21] These tectonic changes occurred in the western Pacific Ocean,
      pointing to an origin there, with molecular data suggesting two later,
      separate invasions of the Atlantic Ocean.[22] In 2016, a study published
      in Nature found the seahorse genome to be the most rapidly evolving fish
      genome studied so far.[23] The evolution of seahorses from pipefish may
      have been an adaptation related to the biomechanics of prey capture. The
      unique posture of the seahorse allows them to capture small shrimps at
      larger distances than the pipefish is capable of.[24]

    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The male seahorse is equipped with a brood pouch on the ventral, or
      front-facing, side of the tail. When mating, the female seahorse deposits
      up to 1,500 eggs in the male's pouch. The male carries the eggs for 9 to
      45 days until the seahorses emerge fully developed, but very small. The
      young are then released into the water, and the male often mates again
      within hours or days during the breeding season.[25]
